# Geri Jennings
Geri is a well-respected member of the cloud native security community, and often volunteers her time to push community efforts forward. She is also well-versed in the AuthN and identity space, and is one of the authors of the Secretless project. Geri has seen the problems first hand, and spends a significant amount of time thinking about them. If she accepts this nomination and is elected, I think Geri's experience and perspective will become a central and indispensable part of the SSC.
