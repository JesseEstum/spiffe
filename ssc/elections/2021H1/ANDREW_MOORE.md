# Andrew Moore

Since February 2019, in his role as software engineer at Uber, Andrew has directly contributed to the adoption of SPIFFE and SPIRE at Uber. He has worked on integrating SPIRE with a diverse set of production workloads at Uber ranging from low-level infrastructure platforms to higher level services, workflows, and build/test jobs. He has also made significant contributions to Uber authentication libraries leveraging SPIFFE identity delivered by SPIRE that are widely adopted across the organization. Andrew has 1.5 years experience of operating a large-scale deployment of SPIRE at Uber. He is one of the top contributors to the SPIRE project by number of commits and lines of code contributed.

Andrew is an advocate for SPIFFE at Uber, establishing consensus with service and platform owners at Uber and establishing internal best practices and conventions. He has planned and executed SPIFFE ID path convention migrations and understands many of the challenges with the workload identity problem space. For these reasons, I believe Andrew Moore would be a good fit for the SSC.
